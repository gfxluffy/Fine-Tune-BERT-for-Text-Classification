# Fine-Tune-BERT-for-Text-Classification
Coursera Guided Project

Fine-tuning a Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding (BERT) model for text classification with TensorFlow

The project covers:
- Building TensorFlow Input Pipelines for Text Data with the [tf.data](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data) API
- Tokenizing and Preprocessing Text for BERT
- Fine-tuning BERT for text classification on a custom dataset with TensorFlow 2 and [TF Hub](https://tfhub.dev/)
- Predicting whether given sentences are insincere or not

Dataset Used: [Quora Insincere Questions](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification/data) - customized
