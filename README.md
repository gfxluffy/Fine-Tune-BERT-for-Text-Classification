# Fine-Tune-BERT-for-Text-Classification
Coursera Guided Project

Fine-tuning a Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding (BERT) model for text classification with TensorFlow

The project covers
- Building TensorFlow Input Pipelines for Text Data with the `[tf.data](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data)` API
- Tokenizing and Preprocessing Text for BERT
- Fine-tuning BERT for text classification on a custom dataset with TensorFlow 2 and `[TF Hub](https://tfhub.dev/)`

Dataset: Quora Insincere Questions (Kaggle) - customized
Objective: Predict whether given sentences are insincere or not
